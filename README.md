CloudSmartHome
CloudSmartHome is a cloud-native smart home solution designed and implemented as part of a cloud engineering project. Leveraging the power of AWS and Terraform, CloudSmartHome provides a scalable and resilient microservices network for managing home automation systems.

Overview
CloudSmartHome was developed with the aim of revolutionizing home automation through cloud technologies. It offers a modular microservices architecture built on AWS infrastructure, allowing for seamless integration and management of various smart home devices.

Architecture
The architecture of CloudSmartHome is meticulously crafted to ensure optimal performance, security, and scalability. Key components of the architecture include:

Networking
CloudSmartHome establishes a robust Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. The VPC architecture incorporates Public and Private subnets, providing a secure and segregated environment for different components of the system.

Security
Security is paramount in CloudSmartHome. The system implements a multi-layered security approach, including:

Secure bastion host architecture for controlled access to EC2 instances.
Fine-grained security groups for enforcing access controls and network isolation.
Encrypted communication channels to safeguard sensitive data.
Databases
CloudSmartHome utilizes DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service, for storing and managing data related to smart home devices. The database design is optimized for performance and scalability, ensuring seamless operation even under high loads.

App Services
The application layer of CloudSmartHome consists of microservices deployed on EC2 instances. Each service is designed to handle specific functionalities such as device control, data processing, and user authentication. The services are deployed in a highly available and fault-tolerant manner to ensure uninterrupted operation.

Load Balancing
To distribute incoming traffic efficiently and ensure high availability of services, CloudSmartHome employs Application Load Balancers (ALBs) for public-facing services and internal load balancers for inter-service communication. The load balancers intelligently route traffic to healthy instances, providing a seamless user experience.

Autoscaling
CloudSmartHome leverages autoscaling capabilities to dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on workload demand. This ensures optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency, allowing the system to scale seamlessly with changing requirements.
